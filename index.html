            <p>COVID 19 catapulted a wave of unprecedented challenges and has had a staggering impact on the job market. As this pandemic spread across the globe, businesses faced an abundance of economic uncertainty and reduced consumer demand. To combat this, these businesses had to resort to cost-cutting measures — and to many, this meant layoffs. </p>
            <p>This pandemic's impact on layoffs has been far-reaching and has affected many different industries, with some being impacted more than others. </p>

            <div id="table_plot" class="center_plot"></div>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted severe blows on many different sectors, with the consumer, retail, and transportation industries being the few hit the hardest. As lockdown measures and travel restrictions took hold, consumer spending plummeted, and so did the success of these companies. The retail industry faced similar challenges when consumers weren’t able to step foot in stores. And similarly, the transportation industry suffered a near standstill as airlines, cruse lines, and public transit were essentially gone. On the other hand, some industries were able to withstand COVID’s massive impact. The manufacturing, aerospace, and energy industry were shown to be the most resilient, and had the clear least amount of layoffs.</p>

            <p>The impact of layoffs due to the COVD-19 pandemic has been unevenly distributed across the states, with some regions experiencing more significant repercussions than others.</p>
            <div id="geometric_plot" class="center_plot"></div>
            <p>California, Washington, and New York have borne the brunt of the most devastating effects that were brought by COVID-19. As the most populous state in the United States, California experienced widespread layoffs across many different industries. Washington, home to many tech giants and aerospace companies, also was severly affected. New York, a hub known for its arts and culture suffered a lot due to the halt in tourism and strict lockdown measures. </p>

            <p>In the aftermath of the COVD-19 pandemic, each industry faced its own set of challenges, resulting in significant amounts of layoffs that impacted the top companies within each sector.</p>
            <div id="network_plot" class="center_plot"></div>
            <p>For example, in the consumer industry, the impact of layoffs has been felt strongly among top companies, with Meta, Google, Twitter, ByteDance, and Yahoo all facing significant workforce reductions. Each industry faces its own struggle, and there are definitely certain company names in each industry that are to be wary of in regards to layoffs.</p>
            <p>The magnitude of layoffs in the aftermath of COVID-19 cannot be understated. From the consumer industry to technology, retail, transportation, and beyond, companies across various sectors faced the harsh reality of downsizing their workforce. As we reflect on the magnitude of layoffs post-COVID, it is evident that there are measures that need to be taken to address the lasting impacts of these unprecedented layoffs, in addition to paving the way for a more resilient future. </p>
